# kyeb dotfiles

Dotfiles for my 2 UNIX setups - macOS at work, and Arch Linux at play.

Uses [anishathalye](https://github.com/anishathalye)'s wonderful
[Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) project to install itself.
Installation directions are simply:

```
git clone https://github.com/kyeb/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./install
```

# things you can find in this repo

- neovim setup

- some outdated setup for my arch linux desktop environment (sway/i3, nnn,
  rofi, zathura)
