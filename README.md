# kyeb dotfiles

Dotfiles for my 2 UNIX setups - macOS at work, and Arch Linux at play.

Uses [anishathalye](https://github.com/anishathalye)'s wonderful [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) project to install itself. Installation directions are simply:

```
git clone https://github.com/kyeb/dotfiles .dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./install
```
