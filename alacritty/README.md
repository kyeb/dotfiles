# What's going on here?

Unfortunately, the window decoration I like for Alacritty in macOS breaks the
configuration in Linux. So, I have set a separate configuration file for Linux,
that I will have to manually keep in sync for options that I want synchronized.

My `sway` config file points Alacritty to the alternate config every time I run
it using the keyboard shortcut.
